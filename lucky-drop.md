# Lucky Drop

1. Lucky Drop is an algorithm-based open-source airdrop game. For each AIBULL transaction, a 3% fee is extracted, converted into ARB, and added to the prize pool, which is then distributed through lucky draw tickets.
2. Participation requirements:

a. There are 20 levels of lucky draw tickets (for transactions between $50 - $1000).

b. Transactions under $50 will not receive lucky draw ticket, while transactions above $1000 will receive a ticket equivalent to $1000.

c. The higher the level of the lucky draw ticket, the greater the probability of winning. Each transaction can only receive one lucky draw ticket.

3. Lucky Drop takes place every 60 minutes. After the draw, all lucky draw tickets from the current round become invalid.
