# Tokenomics

AIBULL is a deflationary token for the operation of the ArBULL ecosystem. It is an essential key to unlock the next chapters of the ArBULL story.

The total supply of AIBULL tokens is 1,000,000,000,000.

## Distribution Method:

100% of AIBULL tokens will be distributed to the community and liquidity pool

* 79% of the total amount of AIBULL will go directly into the airdrop pool and will be claimed by users
* 6% of the total amount of AIBULL will be rewarded to the inviters while stocks last.
* 15% of the total amount of AIBULL will be used to add liquidity (AIBULL/ETH) together with ETH provided by users when they claim from the airdrop pool. After 4 weeks, all remaining AIBULL left for this portion will be burnt.

Any unclaimed tokens will be included in future usage plans: protocol long-term development, early supporters, long-term community supporters, and burning.

## Claiming Method

Users who are eligible for the ARB airdrop can claim AIBULL by logging into their wallet on the official website. The distribution is on a first come, first served basis. The amount of tokens to be claimed for each user will decrease in each interval based on the total token supply, as follows:
